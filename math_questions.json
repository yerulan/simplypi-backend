      "explanation": "The cost for the first 1000 units is $30,000. The cost for the second 1000 units is 20% more than $30,000, which is $36,000. The cost for the third 1000 units is again 20% more than $30,000, hence another $36,000. Therefore, the total cost for 3000 units is $30,000 + $36,000 + $36,000 = $102,000.",

      "explanation": "At 25°C, the increase from 20°C is 5°C, which results in an increase of 5 * 0.5 grams = 2.5 grams. Therefore, the dissolution rate at 25°C is 4 grams + 2.5 grams = 6.5 grams per liter.",

Assuming the rate of increase continues, we can estimate April's sales as approximately 135 plus the increase from January to February, which is 30, leading to estimated sales of 135 + 30 = 165.

      "explanation": "Let x be the number of chocolates and y be the number of gummies. We can set the following equations based on the problem statement: x + y = 12 (total candies) and 3x + 2y = 30 (total cost).

      "question": "If the sum of two numbers is 48 and one number is 12 more than the other, what are the two numbers?",
      "explanation": "Let the two numbers be x and y. According to the problem, we can set up the following equations: x + y = 48 and x = y + 12. Substituting the second equation into the first, we have (y + 12) + y = 48, which simplifies to 2y + 12 = 48. Solving for y gives us y = 18, and thus x = 30. Therefore, the two numbers are 30 and 18.",

      "question": "If the sum of two numbers is 35 and their difference is 15, what is the value of the larger number?",
      "explanation": "Let the two numbers be x and y. The equations we can set up are x + y = 35 and x - y = 15. Solving these equations, we add both: (x + y) + (x - y) = 35 + 15 gives us 2x = 50, thus x = 25. The larger number is 25.",

      "question": "A data set A consists of 5 positive integers less than 100. The mean of these integers is 25. If one of the integers is missing, what is the largest possible value of that integer?",
      "explanation": "To keep the mean at 25 for 5 numbers, the total of these integers must be 125 (25 * 5). If one integer is missing and the average must still hold, it can be calculated that the sum of the remaining 4 numbers must be 125 minus the missing integer. To maximize the missing integer, we minimize the sum of the remaining 4 integers. The smallest distinct positive integers add up to 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4), leaving the largest possible missing integer as 125 - 10 = 115, however, only integers less than 100 are allowed in the set, thus the true max value should not exceed this. The best choice remaining under these conditions would be 95.  Thus, B is the correct choice.",
